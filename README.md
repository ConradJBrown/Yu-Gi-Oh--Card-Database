# Yu-Gi-Oh! card database

## Overview
This program is designed to create a database and inventory system to keep track of cards inventoried, prices of different versions of cards.
Using react the application will be able to keep track of inventory and up to date prices of cards. Hopefully this will be usable by game stores to
help with the sale of cards.

## Plan
### Phase 1
Learn to use react and to create the basics of the program, phase one will consist of me learning to create with react and will end once i am able to
search for a card and have the image of the card appear on my screen with the price of the cards visable.

**Step 1:** Install and create the react app **(DONE)** 

**Step 2:** Create the search bar and button without functionality

### Phase 2
Phase two will begin shortly after phase one has finished. The plan for phase to is to create the actual backend database. This phase will be mostly
me working on how to create the database to hold the inventory of the cards we search for.

### Phase 3
Phase 3 will include me learning to create a check out window and remove the cards from the inventory and also create the logic for calculating prices
and calculating totals
